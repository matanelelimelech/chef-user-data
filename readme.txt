Hi all
I hope you enjoyed today's session and things were pretty clear
Until the next session please work on this assignment:
Write user data script that will help you automating chef execution
You can use the cookbook from our session for this assignment.
the script should:
install chefdk
install git
clone your git repository (that has all needed cookbooks & configurations)
execute chef-solo
Additionally - come with a final idea for your project.
See you next week :cloudschool:


git init
git add <chef>. 
git commit -m "commit1"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourUsername/yourRepository.git
git push -u origin master
git push origin master
